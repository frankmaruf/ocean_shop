Add HSTS(HTTP Strict Transport Security) Settings
HSTS is an HTTP header that helps protect users against man-in-the-middle and protocol downgrade attacks. It’s a way of telling the browser to always use HTTPS for your domain and never using HTTP. This can help you reduce the chances of data breaches due to eavesdropping or changes in the perceived security of transactions.

# settings.py
# HSTS settings  
SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS= 1209600 # 2 weeks 
SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD =True 
SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS=True 

Define ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings

The Allow host option in Django specifies which hosts are allowed to access your website. By default, not all hosts are allowed. 
Therefore, you must specify either a list of explicit hosts or a pattern that is matched against the request’s host header.

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['.example.com']
